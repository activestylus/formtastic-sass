h1. Formtastic Sass Mixins

A few simple, yet powerful macros that add flexible styling to your formtastic forms.

h2. Installation

First we will need to install Haml -- Yes even you ERB enthusiasts who wont drink the Haml-Aid need to get on the Sass track if you are serious about productivity and DRYness. Sass kicks ass!

<pre>
  gem install haml
  cd my_rails_app
  haml --rails
</pre>

1. Set up a master Sass file and include it in your layout
2. Drop this file in the same directory as your master.sass
3. Include this file at the top of that sheet with:

<pre>
  @import formtastic_base.sass
</pre>

Done! Are you ready to churn out beautiful forms in SECONDS?

Let's rock...

h2. Usage and Defaults

You can use the default style like this:

<pre>
  form.formtastic
    +formtastic
</pre>

You can modify the defaults in formtastic_base as follows:

Set width of entire fieldset

<pre>
  !total_width=100%         
</pre>

Set label widths and hint/error left margins

<pre>
  !label_width=24%
</pre>

Set width of inputs, textareas and selects

<pre>
  !input_width=70%          
</pre> 

Set horizontal padding for labels

<pre>
  !label_pad=2%
</pre> 

Set text alignment of labels (Must be either "left" or "right")

<pre>
  !label_float="left"
</pre>

*Note:* Do not mix units (em px %) as it will break the calculations.

Percentages will yield elastic forms.

As for other defaults (color, fonts, etc), the file is well-commented

h2. The Magic

In order to set the basic layout, you don't need to even touch the defaults.

<pre>
  form.formtastic
    +formtastic(510px,100px,400px,8px,"right")
</pre>

Fun trick: Compass users can also put Bluepint, 960, YUI grid values in there.

h2. Alternative Inline Order

You can align labels with error messages so they read like sentences.

Create formtastic.rb in config/initializers and add this:
<pre>
  Formtastic::SemanticFormBuilder.inline_order = [:errors, :input, :hints]
</pre>

This is best used with right-aligned labels
<pre>
  form.formtastic
    +formtastic(100%,20%,70%,4%,"right")
</pre>

You will need to provide a margin-top value to align labels with error messages, trial and error is your friend here:

<pre>
  form.formtastic
    +formtastic(100%,20%,70%,4%,"right")
    +formtastic-errors-on-top(21px)
</pre>

h2. Hacks

Thanks to the misbehavior of legend tags, a tweaks is needed for Safari. Just set a pixel or em width on the legend's span like this

<pre>
  form.formtastic 
    +formtastic
    +formtastic-safari-hack(120px)
</pre>

Internet Explorer is not yet supported. Patches are welcome.

h2. Caveat

Overall this is still very alpha so please test across browsers before using in production.

Enjoy!
